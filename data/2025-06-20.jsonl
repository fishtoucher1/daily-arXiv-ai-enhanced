In this paper, optimal regularity properties of the solution $u$ are established in Sobolev-Lorentz spaces $L_α^{p,q}(Ω)$ of order $ α$ less than but arbitrarily close to $2$.

In particular, we propose a mathematical model that accounts for the spatial segregation observed between two species of mosquito vectors of numerous viruses. Indeed, it has been observed that, in tropical regions, Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are well established in urban areas whereas Aedes albopictus mosquitoes spread widely in forest regions. Moreover, these species of mosquitoes compete with each other in the larval stage. Based on these observations, we introduce a simple mathematical model to account for this phenomenon. This model consists of a system of reaction-diffusion equations describing the dynamics of the aquatic and aerial phases of each species in a spatially heterogeneous environment. The competition takes place at the aquatic phase and is assumed to be strong which allows us to reduce the dimensionality of the system. We first establish a sufficient condition on the parameters to prevent one species from invading another in a homogeneous environment. Next, using this sufficient condition, we show that spatial segregation may be observed in a spatially heterogeneous environment. Our theoretical results are also illustrated by some numerical simulations."}

We show that, with those distinguished solutions it is possible to associate an `auxiliary' continuity equation, in an augmented phase space, solely driven by its velocity field. For that continuity equation, a standard version of the superposition principle can be thus obtained. In this way, we derive a first probabilistic representation of the pair $(μ,ν)$ solutions by projection over the time and space marginals. This representation involves Lipschitz trajectories in the augmented phase space, reparametrized in time and solving the characteristic system of ODEs. Finally, for the same pair $(μ,ν)$ we also prove a superposition principle in terms of BV curves on the actual time interval, providing a fine description of their behaviour at jump points."}

Krasnoschok obtained similar results for the time-fractional diffusion equation.

We began this analysis in [22] where we rigorously proved the existence of a stationary non-equilibrium solution and established the different behaviour of the solutions for small and large values of the shear parameter, for cut-off collision kernels with homogeneity parameter $0\\leq γ<1$, including Maxwell molecules and hard potentials. In this paper, we concentrate in the case where the deformation term dominates the collision term for large times (hyperbolic-dominated regime). This occurs for collision kernels with $γ< 0$ and in particular we focus on $γ\\in (-1,0)$. In such a hyperbolic-dominated regime, it appears challenging to provide a clear description of the long-term asymptotics of the solutions. Here we present a formal analysis of the long-time asymptotics for the distribution of velocities and provide the explicit form for the asymptotic profile. Additionally, we discuss the different asymptotic behaviour expected in the case of homogeneity $γ< -1$. Furthermore, we provide a probabilistic interpretation describing a stochastic process consisting in a combination of collisions and shear flows.

Spence"], "title": "Non-uniform finite-element meshes defined by ray dynamics for Helmholtz problems", "categories": ["math.NA", "math.AP"], "comment": null, "summary": "The $h$-version of the finite-element method ($h$-FEM) applied to the high-frequency Helmholtz equation has been a classic topic in numerical analysis since the 1990s. It is now rigorously understood that (using piecewise polynomials of degree $p$ on a mesh of a maximal width $h$) the conditions \"$(hk)^p ρ$ sufficiently small\" and \"$(hk)^{2p} ρ$ sufficiently small\" guarantee, respectively, $k$-uniform quasioptimality (QO) and bounded relative error (BRE), where $ρ$ is the norm of the solution operator with $ρ\\sim k$ for non-trapping problems. Empirically, these conditions are observed to be optimal in the context of $h$-FEM with a uniform mesh. This paper demonstrates that QO and BRE can be achieved using certain non-uniform meshes that violate the conditions above on $h$ and involve coarser meshes away from trapping and in the perfectly matched layer (PML). The main theorem details how varying the meshwidth in one region affects errors both in that region and elsewhere. One notable consequence is that, for any scattering problem (trapping or nontrapping), in the PML one only needs $hk$ to be sufficiently small; i.e. there is no pollution in the PML.\n  The motivating idea for the analysis is that the Helmholtz data-to-solution map behaves differently depending on the locations of both the measurement and data, in particular, on the properties of billiards trajectories (i.e. rays) through these sets. Because of this, it is natural that the approximation requirements for finite-element spaces in a subset should depend on the properties of billiard rays through that set. Inserting this behaviour into the latest duality arguments for the FEM applied to the high-frequency Helmholtz equation allows us to retain detailed information about the influence of $\\textit{both}$ the mesh structure $\\textit{and}$ the behaviour of the true solution on local errors in FEM."}
