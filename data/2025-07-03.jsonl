To\nbe specific, for all $1 < p, q < \\infty$, we demonstrate that $$\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left( \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{d}} \\left| \\phi(\\Delta)w \\right|^{p}\n\\mu_{1}(x) \\, dx \\right)^{\\frac{q}{p}} \\mu_{2}(t) \\, dt \\leq C\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left( \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{d}} |h|^{p} \\mu_{1}(x) \\, dx\n\\right)^{\\frac{q}{p}} \\mu_{2}(t) \\, dt, $$ where $\\mu_{1}(x) \\in\nA_{p}(\\mathbb{R}^{d})$ and $\\mu_{2}(t) \\in A_{q}(\\mathbb{R})$ are\n\\emph{Muckenhoupt} weights.~Our proof relies on harmonic analysis techniques,\nusing fundamental tools including the \\emph{Fefferman-Stein} inequality and\n\\emph{Hardy-Littlewood} maximal estimates in weighted $L_q(L_p)$ spaces, and\n\\emph{sharp function} estimates for solution operators. In particular, our\nresults extend the work of Han and Kim (2020, J. Differ. Equ.,269:3515-3550)\nand complement the work of Dong (2023, Calc. Var. Partial Differ. Equ., 62:96)."}

We show the existence of weak asymptotic solutions to the\ninitial value problem to the system using a regularisation, by a vanishing\nviscosity method when the initial velocity is bounded measurable, the initial\nvolume fraction is integrable and the boundary data are bounded measurable.\nHere we use a generalization of the Hopf-Cole transformation.
