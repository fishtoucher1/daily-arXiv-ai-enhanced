In dimension four, these\nassumptions hold automatically, yielding unconditional uniqueness and\nconvergence. In particular, our results show that all asymptotically\ncylindrical Calabi--Yau manifolds converge exponentially to their asymptotic\nlimits, thereby answering affirmatively a question by\nHaskins--Hein--Nordstr\\\"om. In dimension four our result strengthens those of\nChen--Chen, who proved exponential convergence to its asymptotic limit space\nfor any ALH instanton."}

The main novelty of this paper is that the\ndomains may be unbounded, including of infinite volume.\n  First, we prove a sharp upper bound for the infimal energy among all\n$k$-partitions by a threshold value which involves the infimum $\\Sigma$ of the\nessential spectrum of the Schr\\\"odinger operator on the whole domain as well as\nthe infimal energy among all $k-1$-partitions. Strictly below such threshold,\nwe develop a concentration-compactness-type argument showing optimal partitions\nexist, and each cell admits ground states (i.e., the infimum of the spectrum on\neach cell is a simple isolated eigenvalue).\n  Second, for $p<\\infty$, when the energy and the threshold level coincide, we\nshow there may or may not be minimizing partitions. Moreover, even when these\nexist, they may not have ground states.\n  Third, for $p=\\infty$, minimal partitions always exist, even at the threshold\nlevel, but these may or may not admit ground states. Moreover, below the\nthreshold, we can always construct a minimizer, which is an equipartition. At\nthe threshold value we show that spectral minimal partitions may not need to be\nequipartitions.\n  We give a variety of examples of both domains and potentials to illustrate\nthe new phenomena that occur in this setting."}

The resulting\nclosed-loop dynamics are governed by a nonlinear evolution equation; we\nestablish its solvability and hence the applicability of funnel control to this\nclass.

By\nemploying the techniques from the comparison principle, we identify the Laplace\nlimit as the convergence of the viscosity solution of the associated\nsecond-order singularly perturbed Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. A key\nadvantage of this method is that it establishes a Laplace principle without\nrelying on additional sufficient conditions such as Bryc's theorem, which the\nliterature commonly requires. For $r>3$ and $r=3$ with $2\\beta\\mu\\geq1$, we\nalso derive the exponential moment bounds without imposing the classical\northogonality condition\n$((\\boldsymbol{u}_n\\cdot\\nabla)\\boldsymbol{u}_n,\\mathrm{A}\\boldsymbol{u}_n)=0$,\nwhere $\\mathrm{A}=-\\Delta$, in both two-and three-dimensions. We first\nestablish the large deviation principle in the Skorohod space. Then, by using\nthe $\\mathrm{C}-$exponential tightness, we finally establish the large\ndeviation principle in the continuous space."}
