In dimension four, these\nassumptions hold automatically, yielding unconditional uniqueness and\nconvergence. In particular, our results show that all asymptotically\ncylindrical Calabi--Yau manifolds converge exponentially to their asymptotic\nlimits, thereby answering affirmatively a question by\nHaskins--Hein--Nordstr\\\"om. In dimension four our result strengthens those of\nChen--Chen, who proved exponential convergence to its asymptotic limit space\nfor any ALH instanton."}

The main novelty of this paper is that the\ndomains may be unbounded, including of infinite volume.\n  First, we prove a sharp upper bound for the infimal energy among all\n$k$-partitions by a threshold value which involves the infimum $\\Sigma$ of the\nessential spectrum of the Schr\\\"odinger operator on the whole domain as well as\nthe infimal energy among all $k-1$-partitions. Strictly below such threshold,\nwe develop a concentration-compactness-type argument showing optimal partitions\nexist, and each cell admits ground states (i.e., the infimum of the spectrum on\neach cell is a simple isolated eigenvalue).\n  Second, for $p<\\infty$, when the energy and the threshold level coincide, we\nshow there may or may not be minimizing partitions. Moreover, even when these\nexist, they may not have ground states.\n  Third, for $p=\\infty$, minimal partitions always exist, even at the threshold\nlevel, but these may or may not admit ground states. Moreover, below the\nthreshold, we can always construct a minimizer, which is an equipartition. At\nthe threshold value we show that spectral minimal partitions may not need to be\nequipartitions.\n  We give a variety of examples of both domains and potentials to illustrate\nthe new phenomena that occur in this setting."}

By\nemploying the techniques from the comparison principle, we identify the Laplace\nlimit as the convergence of the viscosity solution of the associated\nsecond-order singularly perturbed Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. A key\nadvantage of this method is that it establishes a Laplace principle without\nrelying on additional sufficient conditions such as Bryc's theorem, which the\nliterature commonly requires. For $r>3$ and $r=3$ with $2\\beta\\mu\\geq1$, we\nalso derive the exponential moment bounds without imposing the classical\northogonality condition\n$((\\boldsymbol{u}_n\\cdot\\nabla)\\boldsymbol{u}_n,\\mathrm{A}\\boldsymbol{u}_n)=0$,\nwhere $\\mathrm{A}=-\\Delta$, in both two-and three-dimensions. We first\nestablish the large deviation principle in the Skorohod space. Then, by using\nthe $\\mathrm{C}-$exponential tightness, we finally establish the large\ndeviation principle in the continuous space."}
