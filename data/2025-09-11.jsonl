Although it has\nbeen extensively studied by many authors, we would like to return to a number\nof fundamental questions and known results, such as the traces and the maximal\nregularity of solutions. First, to treat non-homogeneous boundary conditions,\nwe rigorously define the notion of traces for non regular functions. This\napproach replaces the non-tangential trace notion that has dominated the\nliterature since the 1980s. We identify a functional space E = \\{v\\in\nH^{1/2}(\\Omega);\\nabla v\\in [H^1/2(\\Omega)]'\\} for which the trace operator is\ncontinuous from $E$ into $L^2(\\Gamma)$. Second, we address the regularity of\nsolutions to the Laplace equation with homogeneous Dirichlet conditions. Using\nspecific equivalent norms in fractional Sobolev spaces and Grisvard's results\nfor polygons and polyhedral domains, we prove that maximal regularity $H^{3/2}$\nholds in any BLD $\\Omega$, for all right-hand sides in the dual of\n$H^{1/2}_{00}(\\Omega)$. This conclusion contradicts the prevailing claims in\nthe literature since the 1990s. Third, we describe some criteria which\nestablish new uniqueness results for harmonic functions in Lipschitz domains.\nIn particular, we show that if $u\\in H^{1/2}(\\Omega)$ or $u\\in W^{1,\n2N/(N+1)}(\\Omega)$, is harmonic in $\\Omega$ and vanishes on $\\Gamma$, then $u=\n0$. These criteria play a central role in deriving regularity properties.\nFinally, we revisit the classical Area Integral Estimate. Using Grisvard's work\nand an explicit function given by Necas, we show that this inequality cannot\nhold in its stated form. Since this estimate has been widely used to argue that\n$H^{3/2}$-regularity is unattainable for data in the dual of\n$H^{1/2}_{00}(\\Omega)$, our counterexample provides a decisive clarification."}
