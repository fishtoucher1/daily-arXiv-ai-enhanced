A\ncareful analysis of the domain Green's functions far from the periodic\nstructure is then used to prove that the analytically continued equation is\nFredholm index zero. Finally, we show that the solution we generate satisfies a\nradiation condition and demonstrate an efficient and high order solver for this\nproblem."}

This conjecture\nposits the existence and uniqueness (up to isometry) of an asymptotically flat\nstationary vacuum spacetime containing an initial data set $(M, \\mathfrak{g},\n\\Pi)$ that realizes prescribed Bartnik boundary data on $\\partial M$,\nconsisting of the induced metric, mean curvature, and appropriate components of\nthe spacetime extrinsic curvature $\\Pi$.\n  Building on the analytic framework developed in arXiv:2411.02801 for the\nstatic case, we show that, in a double geodesic gauge, the stationary vacuum\nEinstein equations reduce to a coupled system comprising elliptic and\ntransport-type equations, with the genuinely stationary contributions encoded\nin an additional boundary value problem for a $1$-form $\\theta$. Our approach\nemploys both a geodesic gauge for the quotient metric $g$ in the quotient\nformalism and a $\\theta$-geodesic gauge for the $1$-form $\\theta$.\n  We establish local well-posedness for the Bartnik stationary metric extension\nproblem for Bartnik data sufficiently close to that of any coordinate sphere in\na Schwarzschild ${t=0}$ slice, including data with arbitrarily small mean\ncurvature. A key feature of our framework is that the linearized equations\ndecouple: the equations for the metric and potential reduce to the previously\nsolved static case, while the boundary value problem for $\\theta$ is treated\nindependently. We prove solvability of this boundary value problem in the\nBochner-measurable function spaces adapted to the coupled system developed in\narXiv:2411.02801, establishing uniform estimates for the vector spherical\nharmonic decomposition of $\\theta$."}
