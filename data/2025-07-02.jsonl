It is often used to\nunderstand how stable flow can arise even in strongly interacting singular\nconfigurations. Typical examples include the Sadovskii vortex patches and the\nChaplygin-Lamb dipole. Our first result concerns the stability of a nonempty\ncollection of Sadovskii vortex patches with prescribed impulse and unique\ntraveling speed. If the initial vorticity is close to one of these patches, the\nvorticity travels at a similar speed while staying close to the class up to a\nshift. As the closest patch and the shift may vary over time due to ignorance\nof the uniqueness of the Sadovskii patches, we carefully selected the class so\nthat any perturbed solution retains its Sadovskii-like structure uniformly in\ntime and travels nearly at the speed of the patches in the class. This result\nis obtained via a concentration-compactness argument and several uniform\nestimates for the associated variational problem, along with a shift function\nestimate, which is optimal, derived by tracking the horizontal center of mass\nof the perturbed solution. Our second result establishes the existence of\nSadovskii vortices with higher regularity, including compactly supported\nsolutions ranging from vortex patches to functions that are nearly $C^3$.

We consider a setting with sharp low-pass filters and a setting\nwith smooth low-pass filters and argue that - at least theoretically - smooth\nlow-pass filters are operable on a larger class of systems. While our\ntheoretical results are supported with numerical evidence, we also pinpoint\nsome behavior of the numerical method that currently has no theoretical\nexplanation."}

Unlike previous numerical studies, we go beyond the radial case and\ndo not assume any symmetries for n=3, and we only impose an SO(n-1) symmetry in\nhigher dimensions. Our method is based on a hyperboloidal foliation of\nMinkowski spacetime and conformal compactification. We focus on the late-time\npower-law decay (tails) of the solutions and compute decay exponents for\ndifferent spherical harmonic modes, for subcritical, critical and\nsupercritical, focusing and defocusing nonlinear wave equations."}

Our approach enables us to\nextend their result to the full range of parameters, in particular involving\nthe critical case $p=1$, which was excluded in the original work. Our proof\navoids all duality steps and discretization techniques and uses solely\nelementary means."}
