Utilizing duality arguments, we reduce the\ncontrollability analysis to proving suitable observability inequalities for the\ncorresponding adjoint system. We begin with finite-dimensional systems and\nestablish rank-type conditions characterizing controllability. These insights\nare then extended to parabolic partial differential equations with delay and\nmemory terms. By leveraging Carleman estimates and time-dependent control\nstrategies, we derive sufficient conditions under which controllability can be\nachieved. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical results and illustrate\nthe critical role of moving control regions in neutralizing the effects of\nmemory and delay."}

First, we\npresent a Gamma-convergence analysis of this model in the simple case of a\nsingle curve located on the edge of a cylinder. In a numerical section, we\ndetail the numerical optimisation schemes used to minimize this energy for\nnumerous examples, for which good approximations of solutions to Plateau's\nproblem are found."}
