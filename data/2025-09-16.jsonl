Then conditional on a strict\ncomparison between the best constants for the sphere and for the Strichartz\ninequality for the Schr\\\"odinger equations, we prove that there exist functions\nwhich extremize this inequality, and any extremising sequence has a subsequence\nwhich converges to an extremizer. The method is based on the refined\nTomas-Stein inequality for the sphere and the profile decompositions. The key\ningredient to establish orthogonality in profile decompositions is that we use\nTao's sharp bilinear restriction theorem for the paraboloids beyond the\nTomas-Stein range. Similar results have been previously established by Frank,\nLieb and Sabin \\cite{Frank-Lieb-Sabin:2007:maxi-sphere-2d}, where they used the\nmethod of the missing mass."}
