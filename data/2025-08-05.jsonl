This new approach involves: (1)\nconstructing an abstract framework using semigroups and generators; (2)\nformulating a corresponding mean-field evolution problem, and proving its\nwell-posedness; (3) demonstrating the propagation of chaos for a class of\nN-particle systems associated with the mean-field model. Our results are\nreadily applicable to various mean-field models. To demonstrate this, we apply\nour findings to obtain a new result for Levy-type mean-field systems, which\nencompass the McKean-Vlasov diffusion."}

To this aim, we present several novel\nresults concerning the time-frequency analysis of functions with controlled\nGelfand-Shilov regularity, which are of independent interest. As a byproduct,\nwe generalize Vemuri's Gaussian confinement results for the solutions of the\nquantum harmonic oscillator in two respects, namely by encompassing general\nexponential decay rates as well as arbitrary quadratic Schr\\\"odinger\npropagators.
