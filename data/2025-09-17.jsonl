At the heart of the\nproof is the ground state character of the Larson-Penston solution, which\nexhibits important global monotonicity properties used throughout the proof.\n  One of the key challenges is the proof of mode-stability for the non\nself-adjoint spectral problem which arises when linearising the dynamics around\nthe Larson-Penston collapsing solution. To exclude the presence of complex\ngrowing modes other than the trivial one associated with time translation\nsymmetry, we use a high-order energy method in low and high frequency regimes,\nfor which the monotonicity properties are crucially exploited, and use rigorous\ncomputer-assisted techniques in the intermediate regime. In addition, the\nmaximal dissipativity of the linearised operator is proven on arbitrary large\nbackward light cones emanating from the singular point using the global\nmonotonicity of the Larson-Penston solutions. Such a flexibility in linear\nanalysis also facilitates nonlinear analysis and allows us to identify the\nexact number of derivatives necessary for the nonlinear stability statement.\nThe proof is based on a two-tier high-order weighted energy method which ties\nbounds derived from the Duhamel formula to quasilinear top order estimates.
