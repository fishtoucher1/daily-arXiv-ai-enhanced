We\nclassify all Riemann solution problems for scenarios where the left states $L$\nlie along the edge $G$-$W$, and the right states $R$ span nearly the entire\nsaturation triangle, excluding small regions near the boundaries $G$-$O$ and\n$W$-$O$. We use the wave curve method to determine the Riemann solution for\ninitial and injection data within the above-mentioned class. This study extends\nprevious analytical solutions, which were limited to right states near the\ncorner $O$ or within the quadrilateral $O$-$E$-$\\mathcal{U}$-$D$. Notably, this\nclassification remains valid for all viscosity variations satisfying the\ninequalities \\eqref{eq:classical}, corresponding to viscosity regimes where the\numbilic point is close to the vertex $O$. We verify the $L^1_{loc}$-stability\nof the Riemann solution with respect to variations in the data. While we do not\nestablish the uniqueness of the Riemann solution, extensive numerical\nexperiments confirm its validity. Our findings provide a comprehensive\nframework for understanding three-phase flow dynamics in porous media under a\nwide range of conditions."}

However, for nonconvex energies, these\nconstructions have been realized in Euclidean spaces and assume non-degenerate\ncritical points. In this paper, we take a different approach by decoupling the\ntime scales of the energy evolution and of the transition to equilibria.\nNamely, starting from an equilibrium configuration, we let the energy evolve,\nwhile keeping frozen the system state; then, we update the state by freezing\nthe energy, while letting the system transit via gradient flow or an\napproximation of it (e.g., minimizing movement or backward differentiation\nschemes). This approach has several advantages. It aligns with the physical\nprinciple that systems transit through energy-minimizing steady states. It is\nalso fully constructive and computationally implementable, with physical and\ncomputational costs governed by appropriate action functionals. Additionally,\nour analysis is simpler and more general than previous formulations in the\nliterature, as it does not require non-degenerate critical points.
