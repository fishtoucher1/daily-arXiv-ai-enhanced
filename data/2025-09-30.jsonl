We show\nthat in an appropriate diffusive scaling limit with a logarithmic attenuation\nof the noise, the pointwise statistics of the solution can be approximated by\nthe solution to a forward-backward stochastic differential equation (FBSDE).\nThe scaling and structure of the problem is similar to that of the\ntwo-dimensional stochastic heat equation forced by an approximation of\nspace-time white noise considered by the first author and Gu (Ann. Probab.,\n2022). However the resulting FBSDE is different due to the long-range\ncorrelations of the noise."}

A two-dimensional ordinary\ndifferential equation satisfying the stationary problem is derived and all its\ndynamics, including to infinity, is revealed by the Poincar\\'e-Lyapunov\ncompactification, one of the compactifications of phase space. The advantage of\nthis method is that it can be used to classify all dynamical systems\n(especially connecting orbits) of a two-dimensional system including infinity.\nTherefore, the classification results for the dynamical system including to\ninfinity give the classification results for the non-constant stationary states\nobtained only from the structure of the original equations. This argument\nallows us to observe a change in the classification of the non-constant\nstationary states by an explicit relation between the linear diffusion\ncoefficient and the self-diffusion coefficient, combined with arguments about\nthe symmetries and conserved quantities of the ODEs. This means that changing\nthe self-diffusion coefficient as a bifurcation parameter not only\nqualitatively changes the dynamical system from a big saddle homoclinic orbit\nof the ODEs to a heteroclinic orbit that connects the saddle equilibria, but\nalso significantly changes the shape and the properties of the stationary\nstates. It explicitly shows the relationship between linear and self-diffusion,\ngives a characterization of non-trivial stationary states in terms of dynamical\nsystems, and gives a deep insight into the influence of self-diffusion, one of\nthe nonlinear diffusions."}

A posteriori existence results\noffer a way to rigorously verify the existence of strong solutions by ruling\nout blow-up on a certain time interval, using only numerical solutions. In this\nwork we present such a result for the Navier-Stokes equations subject to\nperiodic boundary conditions, which makes use of a version of the celebrated\nblow-up criterion in the critical space $L^\\infty(L^3)$ by Iskauriaza,\nSer\\\"egin and Shverak (2003). Our approach is based on a conditional stability\nestimate in $L^2$ and $L^3$. The a posteriori criterion that, if satisfied,\nverifies existence of strong solutions, involves only negative Sobolev norms of\nthe residual. We apply the criterion to numerical approximations computed with\nmixed finite elements and an implicit Euler time discretisation. A posteriori\nerror estimates allow us to derive a fully computable criterion without\nimposing any extra assumptions on the solution. While limited to short time\nintervals, with sufficient computational resources in principle the criterion\nmight allow for a verification over longer time intervals than what can be\nachieved by theoretical means."}
