Unlike\nprevious work \\cite{BaldiT,BaldiT1,Toland,Toland1}, our formulation\naccommodates rotational flows in finite-depth water. We employ a conformal\nmapping technique to transform the free-boundary problem into a quasilinear\npseudodifferential equation, resulting in a periodic function of a single\nvariable. This reduction allows the existence question for such waves to be\naddressed within the framework of bifurcation theory. With the wavelength\nnormalized to 2$\\pi$, the problem features two free parameters: the wave speed\nand the constant vorticity. Under the assumption of the local convexity of\nundeformed membrane's stored energy, it is observed that the problem, when\nlinearized about uniform horizontal flow, has at most two independent solutions\nfor any values of the parameters. Fixing the vorticity and treating the wave\nspeed as the bifurcation parameter, the linearized problem possesses a single\nsolution. We demonstrate that the full nonlinear problem exhibits a sheet of\nsolutions comprising a family of curves bifurcating from simple eigenvalues.\nTaking both the wave speed and vorticity as parameters, when the constant\nvorticity approaches critical values, the linearized problem exhibits a\ntwo-dimensional kernel. Near these critical points, a secondary bifurcation\ncurve emerges from the primary solution branch. This secondary branch consists\nof ripple solutions on the surface."}

The microscopic model is governed by a coupled fluid-structure\ninteraction system: instationary Stokes equations for the fluid and linear\nelasticity for the solid, with two distinct scalings of the elastic stress\ntensor yielding different effective behaviors.\n  Using two-scale convergence techniques adapted to thin domains and\noscillatory microstructures, the membrane is reduced to an effective interface\nacross which transmission conditions are derived. The resulting macroscopic\nmodel couples the bulk fluid domains via effective interface laws of\nNavier-slip-type including the dynamic displacement. The character of this\ncoupling depends critically on the choice of the scaling in the elastic stress\ntensor, leading to either a membrane equation or a Kirchhoff-Love plate\nequation for the effective displacement.
