Comments are welcome", "summary": "We study the regularity and well-posedness of physical solutions to the\nsupercooled Stefan problem. Assuming only that the initial temperature is\nintegrable, we prove that the free boundary, known to have jump discontinuities\nas a function of the time variable, is $C^1$ as a function of the space\nvariable, and is $C^{\\infty}$ outside of a closed, countable set, which we\ndescribe explicitly. We also prove that, as conjectured in arXiv:1902.05174,\nthe set of positive times when a jump occurs cannot have accumulation points.\nIn addition, we prove that short-time uniqueness of physical solutions implies\nglobal uniqueness, which allows us to obtain uniqueness for very general\ninitial data that fall outside the scope of the current well-posedness regime.\nIn particular, we answer two questions left open in arXiv:1811.12356,\narXiv:2302.13097, regarding the global uniqueness of solutions. We proceed by\nderiving a weighted obstacle problem satisfied by the solutions, which we\nexploit to establish regularity and non-degeneracy estimates and to classify\nthe free boundary points. We also establish a backward propagation of\noscillation property, which allows us to control the occurrence of future jumps\nin terms of the past oscillation of the solution."}

In the complex setting, our method simultaneously addresses\nthe deformed Hermitian--Yang--Mills/Leung--Yau--Zaslow (dHYM/LYZ) equation, the\nMonge--Amp\\`ere equation, and the $J$-equation. Under this ansatz each PDE\nreduces to a second-order system of ordinary differential equations admitting\nexplicit first integrals. These ODE systems integrate in closed form via\nabelian integrals, producing wide families of explicit solutions together with\na detailed description. In particular, on $\\mathbb{C}^3$, we construct entire\ndHYM/LYZ solutions of arbitrary subcritical phase, and on $\\mathbb{R}^3$ we\nproduce entire special Lagrangian solutions of arbitrary subcritical phase.\nMore generally, in any complex or real dimension, our ansatz yields entire\nsolutions of certain subcritical phases for both the dHYM/LYZ and special\nLagrangian equations. Some of these solutions develop singularities on compact\nregions. In the special Lagrangian case we show that, after a natural extension\nacross the singular locus, these blow-up solutions coincide with previously\nknown complete special Lagrangian submanifolds obtained via a different ansatz."}

When the pressure difference increases, the tornado strength increases.\nWhen the pressure difference decreases, the tornado strength decreases. The\ndecay of tornadoes is caused by the decreasing pressure difference. This is our\ntheory of the entire tornado lifespan."}

In all three scenarios, the 'effective time\nstep size' of the scheme scales with the square of the small parameter\n$\\varepsilon$ governing the width of transition layers. A weaker 'slow motion'\nresult is proved under much more general assumptions. Thus, stability is\nachieved by effectively 'freezing' the interfaces in place.
