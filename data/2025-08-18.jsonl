The first week was a summer school consisting of four independent but\nrelated lecture series by Oscar Garc\\'ia Prada, Spiro Karigiannis, Laurent\nManivel, and Ruxandra Moraru. The present document consists of notes for the\nlecture series by Spiro Karigiannis on \"Flows of geometric structures,\nespecially $\\mathrm{G}_2$-structures\". Some assistance in the preparation of\nthese notes by the author was provided by several participants of the summer\nschool. See the Comments field for more information.\n  The main theme is short time existence (STE) and uniqueness for geometric\nflows. We first introduce geometric structures on manifolds and geometric flows\nof such structures. We discuss some qualitative features of geometric flows,\nand consider the notions of strong and weak parabolicity. We focus on the Ricci\nflow, explaining carefully the DeTurck trick to establish short-time existence\nand uniqueness, an argument which we then extend to a general class of\ngeometric flows of Riemannian metrics, previewing similar ideas for flows of\n$\\mathrm{G}_2$-structures. Finally, we consider geometric flows of\n$\\mathrm{G}_2$-structures. We review the basics of $\\mathrm{G}_2$-geometry and\nsurvey several different geometric flows of $\\mathrm{G}_2$-structures. In\nparticular, we clarify in what sense STE results for the $\\mathrm{G}_2$\nLaplacian flow differ from STE results for other geometric flows. We conclude\nwith a summary of some recent results by the author with Dwivedi and\nGianniotis, including a classification of all possible heat-type flows of\n$\\mathrm{G}_2$-structures, and a sufficient condition for such a flow to admit\nSTE and uniqueness by a modified DeTurck trick."}
