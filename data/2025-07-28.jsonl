The latter\ninterpretation suggests a form of asymptotic statistical efficiency for the\neigenvalues of the graph Laplacian. We also present CLTs for multiple\neigenvalues and through several numerical experiments explore the validity of\nour results when some of the assumptions that we make in our theoretical\nanalysis are relaxed."}

We analyze their singularities, defined as the\ninitial configurations for which the minimizer of the associated variational\nproblem is not unique. Moreover, we estimate the size of the closure of the\nsingular set by proving its $\\mathcal{H}^{d(N-1)-1}$-rectifiability, and we\nprovide an upper bound on the Hausdorff dimension of the set of regular\nconjugate points."}

Employing an integral\nequation approach, we rigorously prove the existence of these solutions and\nestablish several fundamental properties, including upper and lower estimates,\nmass conservation, regularity, and monotonicity. To bridge theory and practice,\nwe introduce a family of convergent numerical schemes specifically designed to\ncompute the Barenblatt solutions, ensuring reliable and efficient\napproximations. The theoretical framework is enriched with various examples\nthat illustrate the concepts and validate the effectiveness of the proposed\nnumerical methods, enhancing the understanding and applicability of our\nresults."}
