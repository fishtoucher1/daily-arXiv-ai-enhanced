The microscopic model is a phase-field\nmodel within the Ginzburg-Landau framework for second-order phase transitions,\nwhere the phase-field is directly related to the magnetization vector. This\nmodel couples a nonlinear equation for the magnetization with the quasi-static\nMaxwell system and another nonlinear equation for the temperature.
