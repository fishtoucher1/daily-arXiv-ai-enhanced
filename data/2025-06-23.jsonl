This new result describes the effect that trap\norientation plays on the capture rate and extends existing results that give\ninformation only on the role of trap position on the capture rate. Our results\nare validated against numerical simulations which confirm the accuracy of the\nasymptotic approximation. In the case of the unit disk domain, we identify a\nbifurcation such that the high order correction to the global MFPT (GMFPT) is\nminimized when the trap is orientated in the radial direction for traps\ncentered at $0<r<r_c :=\\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{2}}$. When centered at position $r_c<r<1$,\nthe GMFPT correction is minimized by orientating the trap in the angular\ndirection. In the scenario of a general two-dimensional geometry, we identify\nthe orientation that minimizes the GMFPT in terms of the regular part of the\nNeumann Green's function. This theory is demonstrated on several regular\ndomains such as disks, ellipses and rectangles."}

Assuming the\nweak cosmic censorship conjecture, this implies the formation of multiple black\nholes in finite time. The initial data are obtained by surgically modifying a\nvacuum geometrostatic manifold equipped with the Brill-Lindquist metric: the\ndata agree exactly with the Brill-Lindquist metric outside a collection of\nballs centered at its multiple poles, and each ball is replaced by a\nconstant-time slice of a well-prepared dynamical spacetime. The construction is\nbased on Christodoulou's short-pulse framework, a stability analysis in the\nfinite future of the short-pulse region, the geometry of geometrostatic\nmanifolds with small mass and large separation, and the obstruction-free\nannular gluing method developed by Mao-Oh-Tao. The absence of trapped surfaces\nin the initial data is verified via a standard mean curvature comparison\nargument."}

Domain decomposition\nmethods (DDM) constitute one of the most promising strategy so far, by\ncombining direct and iterative approaches: using direct solvers on overlapping\nor non-overlapping subdomains, as a preconditioner for a Krylov subspace method\non the original Helmholtz system or as an iterative solver on a substructured\nproblem involving field values or Lagrange multipliers on the interfaces\nbetween the subdomains. In this work we compare the computational performance\nof non-overlapping substructured DDM and Optimized Restricted Additive Schwarz\n(ORAS) preconditioners for solving large-scale Helmholtz problems with multiple\nsources, as is encountered, e.g., in frequency-domain Full Waveform Inversion.\nWe show on a realistic geophysical test-case that, when appropriately tuned,\nthe non-overlapping methods can reduce the convergence gap sufficiently to\nsignificantly outperform the overlapping methods."}
