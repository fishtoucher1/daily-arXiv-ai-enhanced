Part III: From mathematical results to engineering application", "categories": ["math.AP", "cond-mat.mtrl-sci"], "comment": null, "summary": "This paper concludes a three-part effort aimed at developing a consistent and\nunified framework for the phase-field modeling of cohesive fracture. Building\non the theoretical foundations established in the first two parts, which\nincluded a $\\Gamma$-convergence result for a broad class of phase-field energy\nfunctionals and the presentation of a rigorous analytical methodology for\nconstructing models tailored to specific cohesive laws, this third paper\nexplores the mechanical response of phase-field models, most of which are\nnovel, associated with different cohesive fracture behaviors within a\none-dimensional framework. Particular emphasis is placed on the possibility of\nformulating distinct phase-field models that, despite exhibiting different\nevolutions of their phase-field and displacement profiles, yield identical\ncohesive fracture responses. Thus, this work aims at providing a practical\ninterpretation of the mathematical framework connecting the theoretical\ninsights established in the previous parts for physical relevant applications."}

When the corner domain is\napproximated by more regular domains, then higher order Sobolev norms of the\nsolutions on these domains can blow up in the limit. We study this blow-up in\nthe simple example of the Laplace operator with Dirichlet conditions in two\nsituations: The rounding of a corner in any dimension, and the two-dimensional\nsituation where a polygonal corner is replaced by two or more corners with\nsmaller angles. We show how an inner expansion derived from a more general\nrecent result on converging expansions into generalized power series can be\nemployed to prove simple and explicit estimations for Sobolev norms and\nsingularity coefficients by powers of the approximation scale."}
