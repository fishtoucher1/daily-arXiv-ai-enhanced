The recommended iterative method\nprovides the solution via a rapidly converging series that readily approaches a\nclosed form solution. The proposed approach is very efficient and essentially\nperfect for determining exact solutions of nonlinear equations. To demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of this method, we examined the extended (2 + 1) dimensional\nequation for thermophoretic motion, which is based on wrinkle wave movements in\ngraphene sheets supported by a substrate. The implementation of the suggested\napproach effectively yielded closed-form solutions in terms of exponential\nfunctions, hyperbolic functions, trigonometric functions, algebraic functions,\nand Jacobi elliptic functions, respectively. Three generated solutions\nillustrated to examine the characteristics of thermophoretic waves in graphene\nsheets. The proposed method's benefits and drawbacks are also examined.\nConsequently, unlike previous solutions obtained via the variation of\nparameters method for nonlinear issues, the solutions presented here are exact\nand unique."}
