This framework captures\nboth diffusion and nonlinear reaction kinetics, and recovers\nLotka-Volterra-type dynamics with species-dependent interactions. Moreover, we\nfind an open subsystem embedded into the larger closed system, that contains\nthe physical and ecological important quantities. By analyzing different\nasymptotic regimes in the reaction parameters of the resulting system, we\nformally derive classical Holling type I, II, and III functional responses. To\nrigorously justify these reductions and their dynamical properties, we apply\nthe generalized geometric singular perturbation theory (GSPT) for PDEs and\nprove the existence of an attracting and invariant slow manifolds near the\ncritical manifold of the reduced system.

Our\nresults extend the Lorentzian splitting theorem proved for smooth globally\nhyperbolic spacetimes by Galloway -- and variants of its weighted counterparts\nby Case and Woolgar--Wylie -- to this low regularity setting."}

The resulting equation is fully nonlinear and\nnon-concave. We prove long-time existence for equations whose exponents are not\ntoo far apart and give conditions for convergence to the twisted Monge-Amp\\`ere\nwhen the exponents approach each other. Applications include long-time\nconvergence on K\\\"ahler backgrounds and reduction to the twisted Monge-Amp\\`ere\nequation under curvature assumptions."}
