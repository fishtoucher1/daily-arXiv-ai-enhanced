By exploiting the stabilizing effect induced by the\nbackground magnetic field and constructing a hierarchy of four energy\nfunctionals, we establish global-in-time uniform bounds that are independent of\nthe viscosity in the $x_2$ and $x_3$ directions and the vertical resistivity. A\nkey innovation in our analysis is the development of a two-tier energy method,\nwhich couples the boundedness of conormal derivatives with the decay of\ntangential derivatives. These global conormal regularity estimates, together\nwith sharp decay rates, enable us to rigorously justify the vanishing\ndissipation limit and derive explicit long-time convergence rates to the MHD\nsystem with vanishing dissipation in the $x_2$ and $x_3$ directions and no\nvertical magnetic diffusion. In the absence of a magnetic field, the\nglobal-in-time vanishing viscosity limit for the 3D incompressible\nNavier-Stokes equations with anisotropic dissipation remains a challenging open\nproblem. This work reveals the mechanism by which the magnetic field enhances\ndissipation and stabilizes the fluid dynamics in the vanishing viscosity limit."}

To overcome logarithmic divergences at\nthe $H^{1/2}$ regularity, we exploit the $B^{0+}_{\\infty,1}$ control of\nsolutions provided by a refined Strichartz estimate. Our NFR argument consists\nof two stages: we first use NFR finitely many times to derive an intermediate\nequation in which the main cubic nonlinearity is restricted to a certain type\nof frequency interaction; we then apply the infinite NFR scheme to the\nintermediate equation.

This condition is derived from a second-order ordinary differential\nequation whose solution produces a barrier that appears to be novel in the\ncontext of barrier constructions. It admits an explicit formulation and, in the\nsetting of Hadamard manifolds, reveals a direct and transparent relationship\nbetween the geometry of the domain and the behavior of the boundary data\nrequired for solvability. The condition also extends naturally to unbounded\ndomains. In the Euclidean case, it is not only more practical to verify but\nalso less restrictive than the classical Jenkins - Serrin criterion, ensuring\nthe existence of solutions in situations where that approach fail. Furthermore,\nunlike the Jenkins-Serrin condition, our appproach separates the geometric\nproperties of the domain from its boundary data, providing a clearer and more\nmanageable framework for solvability analysis."}

We study a class of 2D edge Hamiltonians modeling a\nmedium which slowly interpolates between periodic bulk media via a domain wall\nacross a \"rational\" line defect. We consider the cases of (1) periodic bulk\nmedia having the symmetries of a square lattice, and (2) linear deformations of\nsuch media. Our bulk Hamiltonians break time-reversal symmetry due to\nperturbation by a magnetic term, which opens a band gap about the band\nstructure degeneracies of the unperturbed bulk Hamiltonian. In case (1), these\nare quadratic band degeneracies; in case (2), they are pairs of conical\ndegeneracies. We demonstrate that this band gap is traversed by two distinct\nedge state curves, consistent with the bulk-edge correspondence principle of\ntopological physics. Blow-ups of these curves near the bulk band degeneracies\nare described by effective (homogenized) edge Hamiltonians derived via\nmultiple-scale analysis which control the bifurcation of edge states. In case\n(1), the bifurcation is governed by a matrix Schr\\\"{o}dinger operator; in case\n(2), it is governed by a pair of Dirac operators. We present analytical results\nand numerical simulations for both the full 2D edge Hamiltonian spectral\nproblem and the spectra of effective edge Hamiltonians."}
