The second problem addresses a semidiscrete Cauchy inverse\nproblem, which involves determining the solution of the stochastic parabolic\nequation in a subdomain of space-time, from the data of the solution and the\ntrace of the discrete spatial derivative on a subdomain of the boundary of\nspace and time. To address these problems, we establish two Carleman estimates\nfor a semidiscrete stochastic parabolic operator in arbitrary dimensions: one\nfor the homogeneous boundary condition and the other for the nonhomogeneous\nboundary condition. Applying these Carleman estimates, we obtain Lipschitz and\nH\\\"older stability for the first and second inverse problems, respectively."}

To address\nthis difficulty, we introduce a bi-orthogonal basis for the Mittag-Leffler\nfunctions and use it to establish uniqueness and H\\\"older-type stability\nresults, provided the measurement time is sufficiently large. A Tikhonov\nregularization method is then employed to numerically solve the inverse source\nproblem.
