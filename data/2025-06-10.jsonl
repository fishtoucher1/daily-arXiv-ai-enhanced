By reformulating the discrete ADEs as\ndirectional ordinary differential equations (ODEs) along temporal or spatial\ndimensions, we derive analytical solutions that lead to novel update formulas.\nIn essence, the information of discrete ADEs is compressed into these\ndirectional ODEs, which we refer to as representative ODEs. The analytical\nupdate formulas derived from the representative ODEs significantly enhance\nstability, computational efficiency, and spatiotemporal resolution.\nFurthermore, we extend the framework to systems with uncertain parameters and\ncoefficients, showcasing its versatility in addressing complex ADEs encountered\nin modeling and simulation across diverse scientific and engineering\ndisciplines."}

While previous studies have focused on optimal\nmixing rates, the question of its genericity, i.e., whether mixing occurs for\ntypical incompressible flows and typical initial data, remains mathematically\nunclear. In this paper, it is shown that classical mixing criteria, e.g.\ntopological mixing or non-precompactness in $L^2$ for all nontrivial densities,\nfail to persist under arbitrarily small perturbations of velocity fields. A\nYoung-measure theory adapted to $L^\\infty$ data is then developed to\ncharacterize exactly which passive scalars mix. As a consequence, the existence\nof a single mixed density is equivalent to mixing for generic bounded data, and\nthis equivalence is further tied to the non-precompactness of the associated\nmeasure-preserving flow maps in $L^p$. These results provide a foundation for a\ngeneral theory of generic mixing in non-autonomous incompressible flows."}
