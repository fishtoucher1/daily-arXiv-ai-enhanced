All comments are welcome. arXiv admin note: substantial\n  text overlap with arXiv:1510.04479 by other authors", "summary": "Based on the concentration-compactness-rigidity argument in\n\\cite{KenM:NLS,KenM:NLW} and the non-degeneracy of the ground state in\n\\cite{LLTX:Nondeg,LLTX:g-Hart,LTX:Nondeg}, long time dynamics for the focusing\nenergy-critical Hartree equation with radial data have been classified when the\nenergy $E(u_0)\\leq E(W)$ in \\cite{LiMZ:crit Hart,LLTX:g-Hart,MWX:Hart,MXZ:crit\nHart:f rad}, where $W$ is the ground state. In this paper, we continue the\nstudy on the dynamics of the radial solutions with the energy $E(u_0)$ at most\nslightly larger than that of the ground states. This is an extension of the\nresults \\cite{KriNS:NLW rad, KriNS:NLW\nnon,NakR,NakS:NLKG,NakS:book,NakS:NLS,NakS:NLKG:non,Roy} on NLS, NLW and NLKG,\nwhich were pioneered by K. Nakanishi and W. Schlag in \\cite{NakS:NLKG,\nNakS:book} in the study of nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation in the subcritical\ncase. The argument is an adaptation of the works in \\cite{KriNS:NLW rad,\nKriNS:NLW non,NakR,Roy}, the proof uses an analysis of the hyperbolic dynamics\nnear the ground state and the variational structure far from them. The key\ncomponents that allow to classify the solutions are the hyperbolic (ejection)\ndynamical behavior near the ground state and the one-pass lemma."}

Inspired\nby Zhidkov's work on the stability of time-periodic, spatially homogeneous\nstates in the nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation, we develop an alternative\nmethod that relies on an amplitude-phase decomposition and leverages conserved\nquantities tailored to the perturbation equation. We establish an orbital\nstability result of plane waves that is locally uniform in space, accommodating\n$L^2$-localized perturbations as well as nonlocalized phase modulations. In\ncertain regimes, our method even allows for unbounded modulations. Our result\nis sharp in the sense that it holds up to the spectral stability boundary."}
