In our non-dimensional setting each annulus $Ω_{\\cal A}$ is defined via two concentrical balls with radii ${\\cal A}/2$ and ${\\cal A}/2 +1$. For these geometries we provide the exact value for the Poincaré constants for scalar functions and calculate precise Poincaré constants for solenoidal vector fields (in both cases with vanishing Dirichlet traces on the boundary). For this we use the first eigenvalues of the scalar Laplacian and the Stokes operator, respectively. Additionally, corresponding problems in domains $Ω_σ^{*}$, the 3d-annuli are investigated - for comparison but also to provide limits for ${\\cal\n  A}\\,\\to\\,0$. In particular, the Green's function of the Laplacian on $Ω_σ^{*}$ with vanishing Dirichlet traces on $\\partial Ω_σ^{*}$ is used to show that for $σ\\,\\to\\,0$ the first eigenvalue here tends to the first eigenvalue of the corresponding problem on the open unit ball. On the other hand, we take advantage of the so-called small-gap limit for ${\\cal A}\\to\\infty$."}

It is the first time that propagation of chaos is resolved for some many-particle system approximating the Landau equation with Coulomb interactions, and that Kac's program is extended to the Landau equation in the regime of soft potentials. The convergence result is established in the weak sense, in the Wasserstein sense, and in the entropic sense, along with strong convergence in $L^1$.\n  Motivated by the recent work of Bresch, Duerinckx and Jabin \\cite{bresch2024duality}, we develop the duality approach to treat the singular Landau collision operator and adapt to Kac's program in kinetic theory. To overcome the difficulty generated by the Coulomb singularity, we prove some key functional estimates concerning the weighted Fisher information and the second-order Fisher information."}

We provide a compactness result and prove that the Γ-limit of the energy is a multiple of the perimeter. In particular, using the recently introduced unfolding operator for multiple scales, we show that the taking the limit of all of the scales together is equivalent to taking one limit at the time, starting from the smaller scale and keeping the larger fixed."}

We provide a careful analysis of this elliptic system and prove optimal regularity for solutions throughout the branch points. For surfaces confined in the unit ball we show that the minimization problem behaves rather rigid and identify a parameter range for which minimizers are always round spheres."}
