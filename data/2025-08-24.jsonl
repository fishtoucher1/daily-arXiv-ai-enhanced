We consider the problem of masking the effect of an acoustic source\nin a target region where possible detection sensors are located. Masking is\nachieved by placing interference signals near the acoustic source. We introduce\na theoretical and computational framework for designing such interference\nsignals with the goal of minimizing the residual amplitude in the target\nregion. For the three-dimensional (3D) forced wave equation with spherical\nsymmetry, we derive analytical quasi-steady periodic solutions for several\ncanonical cases. We examine the phenomenon of self-masking where an acoustic\nsource with certain spatial forcing profile masks itself from detection outside\nits forcing footprint. We then use superposition of spherically symmetric\nsolutions to investigate masking in a given target region. We analyze and\noptimize the performance of using one or two point-forces deployed near the\nacoustic source for masking in the target region. For the general case where\nthe spatial forcing profile of the acoustic source lacks spherical symmetry, we\ndevelop an efficient numerical method for solving the 3D wave equation.\nPotential applications of this work include undersea acoustic communication\nsecurity, undersea vehicles stealth, and protection against acoustic\nsurveillance."}
