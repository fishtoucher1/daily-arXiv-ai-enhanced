One obstacle is that\nfor $L^{\\infty}$ data, the constitutive law may not be applicable, as Riesz\ntransforms are unbounded.

In the case that $\\alpha\\in(\\frac{1}{2},1]$ and that the\ninitial data has some smoothness (specifically, if the data is in $C^{2}$), we\ndemonstrate a maximum principle and show that this unique solution is actually\nclassical and global in time.

The microscale geometry of the membrane can significantly affect\noverall transport through the membrane, but the precise nature of this\nmultiscale coupling is not well characterised in general. Motivated by the\napplication of transport across a bacterial membrane, in this paper we use\nformal multiscale analysis to derive explicit effective coupling conditions for\nmacroscale transport across a two-dimensional impermeable membrane with\nperiodically spaced gaps, and validate these with numerical simulations. We\nderive analytic expressions for effective macroscale quantities associated with\nthe membrane, such as the permeability, in terms of the microscale geometry.\nOur results generalise the classic constitutive membrane coupling conditions to\na wider range of membrane geometries and time-varying scenarios. Specifically,\nwe demonstrate that if the exterior concentration varies in time, for membranes\nwith long channels, the transport gains a memory property where the coupling\nconditions depend on the system history. By applying our effective conditions\nin the context of small molecule transport through gaps in bacterial membranes\ncalled porins, we predict that bacterial membrane permeability is primarily\ndominated by the thickness of the membrane. Furthermore, we predict how\nalterations to membrane microstructure, for example via changes to porin\nexpression, might affect overall transport, including when external\nconcentrations vary in time. These results will apply to a broad range of\nphysical applications with similar membrane structures, from medical and\nindustrial filtration to carbon capture."}
