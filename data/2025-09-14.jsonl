The CBFeD model describes the behavior of\nincompressible viscous fluid flow through a porous medium, incorporating the\neffects of convection, damping, and nonlinear resistance. The mathematical\nframework captures steady-state flow conditions under a no-slip boundary\nassumption, with a non-monotone boundary condition that links the total fluid\npressure and the velocity's normal component through a Clarke subdifferential\nformulation. To facilitate the analysis, we introduce an auxiliary\nhemivariational inequality resembling a nonlinear Stokes-type problem with\ndamping and pumping terms, which serves as a foundational tool in establishing\nthe existence and uniqueness of weak solutions for the CBFeD model. The\nanalytical strategy integrates techniques from convex minimization theory with\nfixed-point methods, specifically employing either the Banach contraction\nmapping principle or Schauder's fixed point theorem. The Banach-based approach,\nin particular, leads to a practical iterative algorithm that solves the\noriginal nonlinear hemivariational inequality by sequentially solving\nStokes-type problems, ensuring convergence of the solution sequence.\nAdditionally, we derive equivalent variational formulations in terms of\nminimization problems.
