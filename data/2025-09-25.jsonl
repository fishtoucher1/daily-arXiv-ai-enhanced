We prove the existence\nof a global-in-time weak solution, called the flat flow. A difficulty arises\nwhen we establish the local-in-time equi-boundedness of approximate solutions\nand a uniform $L^2$-estimate of multipliers. The difficulty is handled by\nconducting blowup analysis at a point in contact to a spherical cap with sharp\nangle."}

In recent papers by Ebert,Girardi,Reissig (Math. Ann.\n378 (2020)) and Girardi (Nonlinear Differ. Equ. Appl. 32 (2025)), the authors\nobtained a sharp critical condition on $\\mu$ in low space dimensions $n=1,2,3$,\nwhich determines the threshold between global (in time) existence of small data\nsolutions and blow-up of solutions in finite time. Our new results are to prove\nthat this condition remains valid in dimension $n=4$, together with the\nasymptotic profiles of global solutions. From this, we see that the behavior of\nthe solution at $t \\to \\infty$ is identified by the Gauss kernel.

The\nCahn-Hilliard equation includes a nonconservative source term accounting for\nmass exchange, and the velocity equation contains a non divergence-free forcing\nterm.

We consider one\ncontrol called \\textit{leader} and two controls called \\textit{followers}. To\neach leader we associate a Nash equilibrium corresponding to a bi-objective\noptimal control problem; then, we find a leader that solves the null\ncontrollability problem. The linearized degenerated system is treated adapting\nCarleman estimates for degenerated systems from Demarque, L\\'imaco and Viana\n\\cite{DemarqueLimacoViana_deg_sys2020} and the local controllability of the\nnon-linear system is obtained using Liusternik's inverse function theorem. The\nnonlocal coefficient originates a multiplicative coupling in the optimality\nsystem that gives rise to interesting calculations in the applications of the\ninverse function theorem."}
