The lower-dimensional piece is a\nso-called infinite metric tree (one-dimensional branching structure), and the\nkey ingredient of the study is a rigorous definition of the gluing conditions\nbetween the two components. These constructions are based on the recent concept\nof embedded trace maps and some abstract machineries derived from a suitable\nGreen-type formula. The problem is then reduced to the study of Fredholm\nproperties of a linear combination of Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps for the tree\nand the Euclidean domain, which yields desired existence and uniqueness\nresults. One also shows that finite sections of tree can be used for an\nefficient approximation of the solutions."}

However, compared to integer\nordinary or partial differential equations, solving fractional differential\nequations can be challenging considering the intricate details involved in\ntheir numerical solutions. Robust data-driven solutions hence can be of great\ninterest for solving fractional differential equations. In the recent years,\nfractional physics-informed neural network has appeared as a platform for\nsolving fractional differential equations and till now, efforts have been made\nto improve its performance. In this work, we present a fully detailed\ninterrogation of fractional physics-informed neural networks with different\nfoundations to solve different categories of fractional differential equations:\nfractional ordinary differntial equation, as well as two and three dimensional\nfractional partial differential equations. These equations are solved employing\ntwo numerical methods based on the Caputo formalism. We show that these\nplatforms are generally able to accurately solve the equations with minor\ndiscrepancies at initial times. Nonetheless, since in Caputo formalism, the\nvalue of a fractional derivative at each point requires the function's value in\nall of its previous history, it is computationally burdensome. Here, we discuss\nstrategies to improve accuracy of fractional physics-informed neural networks\nsolutions without imposing heavy computational costs."}

In general the\npassage to the limit can be prevented by possible blow-up phenomena captured in\nterms of the Kodaira map and its suitable extension respectively for genus\n$\\mathfrak{g}=2$ and $\\mathfrak{g}=3.$ Here we handle the case of surfaces of\nany genus. In Theorem , we are able to encompass the blow up situation in terms\nof an appropriate \"orthogonality\" condition. Subsequently, we can provide the\nexistence and uniqueness of (CMC) 1-immersions under an appropriate \"generic\"\ncondition, see Theorem 2."}
