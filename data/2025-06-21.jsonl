Indeed, it has been observed that, in\ntropical regions, Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are well established in urban areas\nwhereas Aedes albopictus mosquitoes spread widely in forest regions. Moreover,\nthese species of mosquitoes compete with each other in the larval stage. Based\non these observations, we introduce a simple mathematical model to account for\nthis phenomenon. This model consists of a system of reaction-diffusion\nequations describing the dynamics of the aquatic and aerial phases of each\nspecies in a spatially heterogeneous environment. The competition takes place\nat the aquatic phase and is assumed to be strong which allows us to reduce the\ndimensionality of the system.

It is now rigorously understood that (using piecewise\npolynomials of degree $p$ on a mesh of a maximal width $h$) the conditions\n\"$(hk)^p \\rho$ sufficiently small\" and \"$(hk)^{2p} \\rho$ sufficiently small\"\nguarantee, respectively, $k$-uniform quasioptimality (QO) and bounded relative\nerror (BRE), where $\\rho$ is the norm of the solution operator with $\\rho\\sim\nk$ for non-trapping problems. Empirically, these conditions are observed to be\noptimal in the context of $h$-FEM with a uniform mesh. This paper demonstrates\nthat QO and BRE can be achieved using certain non-uniform meshes that violate\nthe conditions above on $h$ and involve coarser meshes away from trapping and\nin the perfectly matched layer (PML). The main theorem details how varying the\nmeshwidth in one region affects errors both in that region and elsewhere. One\nnotable consequence is that, for any scattering problem (trapping or\nnontrapping), in the PML one only needs $hk$ to be sufficiently small; i.e.\nthere is no pollution in the PML.\n  The motivating idea for the analysis is that the Helmholtz data-to-solution\nmap behaves differently depending on the locations of both the measurement and\ndata, in particular, on the properties of billiards trajectories (i.e. rays)\nthrough these sets. Because of this, it is natural that the approximation\nrequirements for finite-element spaces in a subset should depend on the\nproperties of billiard rays through that set. Inserting this behaviour into the\nlatest duality arguments for the FEM applied to the high-frequency Helmholtz\nequation allows us to retain detailed information about the influence of\n$\\textit{both}$ the mesh structure $\\textit{and}$ the behaviour of the true\nsolution on local errors in FEM."}
