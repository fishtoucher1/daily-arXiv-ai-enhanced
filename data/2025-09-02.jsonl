A key step in our\napproach involves the construction and detailed study of the heat kernel\nassociated with the mixed operator, which we use to develop a theory of mild\nsolutions and establish a comparison principle in suitable weighted function\nspaces.\n  This framework allows us to rigorously establish the non-existence of\ntraveling waves and characterize the large-time spreading rate of solutions. We\nshow that the influence of the fractional Laplacian dominates over the\nclassical Laplacian, especially in the initial layer, where it dictates the\nexponential propagation rate and the thickness of the solution tails."}

For this, we\nconsider a system of coupled Swift--Hohenberg equations with dispersive terms\nand general, smooth nonlinearities. Close to the onset of instability, we\nderive a system of two coupled complex Ginzburg--Landau equations with a\nsingular advection term as amplitude equations and justify the approximation by\nproviding error estimates. We then construct space-time periodic solutions to\nthe amplitude equations, as well as fast-travelling front solutions, which\nconnect different space-time periodic states. This yields the existence of\nsolutions to the pattern-forming system on a finite, but long time interval,\nwhich model the spatial transition between different patterns. The construction\nis based on geometric singular perturbation theory exploiting the fast\ntravelling speed of the fronts. Finally, we construct global, spatially\nperiodic solutions to the pattern-forming system by using centre manifold\nreduction, normal form theory and a variant of singular perturbation theory to\nhandle fast oscillatory higher-order terms."}
