A key feature of this model is that the interior spike can\nundergo Hopf bifurcations in both amplitude and position, leading to rich\noscillatory dynamics not present in classical two-component systems. Using\nasymptotic analysis and numerical path-following, we construct localized spike\nequilibria and analyze spike nucleation that occurs through slow passage beyond\na saddle-node bifurcation. Moreover, stability of spike equilibrium is analyzed\nby introducing time-scaling parameters, which reveal two distinct mechanisms:\namplitude oscillations triggered by large-eigenvalue instabilities and\noscillatory spike motion associated with small eigenvalues. Numerical\nsimulations illustrate these dynamics and their transition regimes. This dual\nmechanism highlights richer spike behavior in three-component systems and\nsuggests several open problems for future study."}
