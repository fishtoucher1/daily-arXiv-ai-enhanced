Passing to the limit as the discretization parameters\nvanish, we obtain a weak solution of the Navier-Stokes equations. A central\ndifficulty is that different a priori bounds are available for the intermediate\nand projected velocity fields; our compactness argument carefully integrates\nthese estimates to complete the convergence proof."}

This\nsynthesis provides a general model for graph-based diffusion with controllable\ndynamics. Our key theoretical results include a quantified two-regime decay\nanalysis for $p>2$, which provides stronger, p-dependent transient bounds not\ncaptured by standard ISS templates, and the first formalization of a\n\"non-synonymy\" impossibility principle, which proves that fixed-parameter\nmodels cannot meet universal performance targets across graphs with varying\nspectral properties. To address this, we propose a constructive calibration\nalgorithm (SGPS) with formal guarantees for achieving target rates and mass. We\nderive explicit, closed-form lower bounds for the graph p-gap on canonical\ngraphs a notable improvement over prior implicit estimates and provide sharp\nconstants for discrete-time and stochastic stability, including a\ncontextualized restatement of the necessary and sufficient Euler step-size and\na strengthened analysis of the stochastic noise floor. Illustrative,\nsmall-scale empirical validations confirm the tightness of key theoretical\nbounds."}

These media are\ncharacterized by physical properties significantly distinct from those of a\nhomogeneous background. The quasi-Minnaert resonance is defined by two primary\nfeatures: boundary localization, where the $L^2$-norms of the internal total\nfield and the external scattered field exhibit pronounced concentration near\nthe boundary, and surface resonance, marked by highly oscillatory behavior of\nthe fields near the boundary. In contrast to classical Minnaert resonances,\nwhich are associated with a discrete spectral spectrum tied to physical\nparameters, quasi-Minnaert resonances exhibit analogous physical phenomena but\nwith a continuous spectral spectrum. Using layer potential theory and rigorous\nasymptotic analysis, we demonstrate that the coupling between a high-contrast\nmaterial structure, particularly with radial geometries, and a carefully\ndesigned incident wave is critical for inducing quasi-Minnaert resonances.\nExtensive numerical experiments, involving radial geometries (e.g., unit disks\nand spheres) and general-shaped geometries (e.g., hearts, Cassini ovals, and\nclovers in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, and spheres in $\\mathbb{R}^3$), validate the\noccurrence of these resonances. Furthermore, we numerically demonstrate that\nquasi-Minnaert resonances induce an invisibility cloaking effect in the\nhigh-contrast medium. These findings have significant implications for\nmathematical material science and the development of acoustic cloaking\ntechnologies."}

This\nprovides evidence for possible connections to microlocal analysis, ie. the\nexact regularity and singularities described in this paper should admit\nwavefront set type descriptions whose propagation is determined by the highest\norder terms of the linear operator. Despite the results being exactly the same\nas those of the wave equation, our proofs are significantly different than the\nproofs for the wave equation. Miraculously, proving our results for the\ncritically damped equation implies them for the general equation, which\nsignificantly simplifies the problem. Even after this simplification, many\nimportant parts of the proof are significantly different than (and we think are\nmore intuitive from the PDE viewpoint compared to) existing proofs for the wave\nequation."}
