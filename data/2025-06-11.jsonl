In this larger family of configurations, we prove that the smooth\ndata suggesting violations of strong cosmic censorship are non-generic in a\n``positive co-dimension'' sense, conditionally to the validity of the expected\nPrice law bounds. Moreover, we illustrate the transition between smooth and\nrough initial data."}

We consider piecewise energy finite functions related to\none-forms, normal parts, and show self-similarity properties of one-forms as in\nthe case of energy finite functions on the Sierpi\\'{n}ski gasket. We introduce\nfirst order differential operators, taking functions into functions, that can\nbe understood as total derivatives with respect to some reference function or\nform. The main result is a pointwise representation result for certain elements\nin the domain of said first order differential operator by a ratio of normal\nderivatives. At last we provide three classes of examples in the domain of said\nfirst order differential operator with different types of discontinuities."}

We will discuss the variational form of nonlninear eigenvalue problems\nand the corresponding non-linear Euler--Lagrange equations, as well as\nconnections with gradient flows. For the latter ones, we will give precise\nconditions for finite time extinction and discuss convergence rates. We will\nuse this theory to study asymptotic behaviour of nonlinear PDEs and present\napplications in $L^\\infty$ variational problems. Finally we will discuss\nnumerical methods for solving gradient flows and computing nonlinear\neigenfunctions based on a nonlinear power method. Our main tools are convex\nanalysis and calculus of variations, necessary background on which will be\nprovided. It is expected that the reader is familiar with Hilbert spaces;\nfamiliarity with Banach spaces is beneficial but not strictly necessary. The\nnotes are based on the lectures taught by the authors at the universities of\nBonn and Cambridge in 2022."}

In the many-particle limit,\nclassical CBO dynamics can be rigorously connected to mean-field equations that\nensure convergence toward global minimizers under suitable conditions. In this\nwork, we draw inspiration from recent extensions of the Kaniadakis--Quarati\nmodel for indistinguishable bosons to develop a novel CBO method governed by a\nsystem of SDEs with superlinear drift and nonconstant diffusion. The resulting\nmean-field formulation in one dimension exhibits condensation-like phenomena,\nincluding finite-time blow-up and loss of $L^2$-regularity. To avoid the curse\nof dimensionality a marginal based formulation which permits to leverage the\none-dimensional results to multiple dimensions is proposed. We support our\napproach with numerical experiments that highlight both its consistency and\npotential performance improvements compared to classical CBO methods."}
