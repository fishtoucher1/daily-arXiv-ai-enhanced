To solve this, we reformulate the inverse problem as a restricted\nminimization problem (RMP), aimed at optimizing a suitably regularized\nobjective functional. We use numerical techniques, specifically the iterative\nL-BFGS-B algorithm implemented in the Dolfin-Adjoint-Python-SciPy libraries, to\nsolve the RMP effectively. Following methodologies similar to those in Pipicano\net al., we establish a local stability result for the RMP. Additionally,\nthrough numerical simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nidentification method in determining the linear velocity coefficient in\nBoussinesq-type systems."}
