When the measure is non-negative, we term the geometry\ncompletely monotone, reflecting the property of its canonical function. We\nidentify a class of positive geometries whose canonical functions admit such\ndual volume representations, characterized by the algebraic boundary cut out by\na hyperbolic polynomial, for which the geometry is a hyperbolicity region. In\nparticular, simplex-like minimal spectrahedra are completely monotone, with\nrepresenting measures related to the Wishart distribution, capturing volumes of\nspectrahedra or their boundaries. We explicitly compute these measures for\npositive geometries in the projective plane bounded by lines and conics or by a\nnodal cubic, revealing periods evaluating to transcendental functions. This\ndual volume perspective reinterprets positive geometries by replacing\nlogarithmic differential forms with probability measures on the dual, forging\nnew connections to partial differential equations, hyperbolicity, convexity,\npositivity, algebraic statistics, and convex optimization."}

Under a set of abstract hypotheses --\nincluding basic structural assumptions on the Hamiltonian, a weak Lyapunov\nstructure, and a quantitative notion of hypoellipticity -- we prove that\ntransition densities satisfy a sharp, uniform pointwise lower bound over\nHamiltonian sublevel sets in the small noise limit $\\epsilon \\to 0$.

As a corollary, assuming a stronger\nLyapunov structure, our main result yields a sharp exponential rate of\nconvergence to equilibrium for $0 < \\epsilon \\ll 1$ in a weighted total\nvariation norm. A central feature of our approach is that it does not require\nknowledge of the explicit form of the invariant measure, nor even its\nexistence, and hence is broadly applicable to deduce minorization for\nphysically relevant systems where invariant measures are inaccessible."}
