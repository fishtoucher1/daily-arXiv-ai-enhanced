The specific $\\mathcal{M}$-operator, originally developed in\n[3], acts as a negative fractional derivative in both spatial and velocity\nvariables and interacts in a controllable manner with the kinetic transport\noperator. The novelty of this method is that it bypasses the need for bounds on\nthe derivatives of the solution - an assumption typically required in\nuniqueness arguments for non-cutoff equations. As a result, the method enables\nworking with solutions with low regularity."}

We cast the coupled MFG system as a\nvariational inequality, overcoming the limitations of prior Hilbert-space\napproaches that relied on high-order regularization and typically yielded only\nweak solutions in the monotone operator sense. In contrast, with our low-order\nregularization, we obtain strong solutions.\n  Our approach addresses the non-coercivity of the underlying MFG operator\nthrough two key regularization strategies. First, by adding a low-order\n$p$-Laplacian term, we restore coercivity, derive uniform a priori estimates,\nand pass to the limit via Minty's method. This establishes, for the first time\nvia monotonicity methods, the existence of strong solutions for models with\nboth standard power-growth and singular congestion, with the latter requiring a\ncareful restriction of the operator's domain. Second, for Hamiltonians with\nonly minimal growth hypotheses, we regularize the Hamiltonian itself via\ninfimal convolution to prove the existence of weak solutions.\n  Our Banach-space framework unifies and extends earlier existence results. By\navoiding high-order smoothing, it not only provides a more direct theoretical\npath but is also ideally suited for modern numerical algorithms."}
