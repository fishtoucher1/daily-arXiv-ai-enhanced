For nondegenerate $C^{\\alpha}$-densities, we prove $C^{1,\n1-\\varepsilon}$-regularity of the potentials up to the boundary. If in addition\nthe boundary is $C^{1, \\alpha}$, we improve this to $C^{2, \\alpha}$-regularity.\nWe also investigate pointwise $C^{1, 1}$-regularity at boundary points. We\nobtain a complete characterization of pointwise $C^{1, 1}$-regularity for\nplanar polytopes in terms of the geometry of tangent cones. Furthermore, we\nstudy the regularity of optimal transport maps with degenerate densities on\ncones, which arise from recent developments in K\\\"ahler geometry. The main new\ntechnical tool we introduce is a monotonicity formula for optimal transport\nmaps on convex domains which characterizes the homogeneity of blow-ups."}

First, we consider the case of negative energy, analyzing separately\nthe cases of radial and non-radial solutions. Then, we examine the positive\nenergy case, where the energy is below that of the ground state and the\n``kinetic'' energy exceeds the corresponding value for the ground state, again\ndistinguishing between radial and non-radial solutions. Our approach is based\non convexity methods, employing virial identities in the analysis."}

Working\nwithin the framework of modular function spaces, we establish the uniform\nconvexity of the modular associated with the gradient term.

The model incorporates 13 macroeconomic and financial\nparameters, including liquidity velocity, market pressure, internal stress,\nstochastic fluctuations, and risk premiums, all based on real data and formally\nincluded in the modified equation. The methodology employs econometric testing,\nFourier analysis, stochastic simulation, and AI-based calibration to enable\ndynamic testing and forecasting. Simulation-based sensitivity analysis\nevaluates the impact of parameter changes on financial balance. The model is\nempirically tested using Georgian macroeconomic and financial data from\n2010-2024, including GDP, inflation, the Gini index, CDS spreads, and LCR\nmetrics. Results show that the model effectively describes liquidity dynamics,\nsystemic risk, and extreme scenarios, while also offering a robust framework\nfor multifactorial analysis, crisis prediction, and countercyclical policy\nplanning."}
